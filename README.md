# Goals, Intentions, Guidelines

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/parthopdas/tddstud10](https://badges.gitter.im/parthopdas/tddstud10.svg)](https://gitter.im/parthopdas/tddstud10?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
  - Environment for practicing Kent Beck style TDD [F.I.R.S.T. Unit Tests, fast builds, No Mocks, Hexagonal architecture]
  - Open source alternative to nCrunch
  - Eventually not just unit tests - but a collection of facilities that makes TDD a joy! e.g. TODO list, hotspot analysis, etc.

# Features that currently work 
  - Enable/Disable TDDStudio
  - Run build/test cycle on every change to any file under the solution folder
  - Incrementalv0 - i.e. build/test happen only for projects that have changed
  - Show code coverage indicators next to each line [green => tests covering it have all passed, red => otherwise]
  - nCrunch style status indicator at the bottom-right in VS Status Bar.
